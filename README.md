# Secrets

Similar to [Whisper](http://whisper.sh/), Secrets is a secret posting application.

The project demonstrates six levels of authentication and security using various [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages and OAuth 2.0 sign in with Google.

## Initial Set-up
Creates the app before any authentication/security measures implemented.

### Create package.json

```sh
$ npm init -y
```

### Install dependencies
```sh
$ npm i express ejs body-parser
```

### Startup MongoDB Server Locally
```sh
$ mongod
```

### Startup Mongo Shell Locally
```sh
$ mongo
```

## Level 1 - Username and Password
Contains a database of user accounts and stores newly created accounts using [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) and [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

### NPM Package - Mongoose
```sh
$ npm i mongoose
```

app.js:
```
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
```

### Registration

### Login

<img src="docs/login1.png"/><br/>

### Registration or Login Success
Upon successful registration or login, the user gets redirected to a page of secrets that other users have posted anonymously.

<img src="docs/registerSuccess.png"/><br/>

### MongoDB New User Added
Below is the Robo3T MongoDB GUI to help visualize the Secrets user database. The first user was registered under the email 1@2.com with a password of 123.

<img src="docs/Robo3T-NewUser1.png"/><br/>

Level 1 username and password creation only provides a very basic level of security as the user name and password is stored as plain text in the database.

## Level 2a - Encryption with mongoose-encryption
The user database is encrypted using [mongoose-encryption](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-encryption) where a secret string defined used to encrypt the database.

### NPM Package - mongoose-encryption
```sh
$ npm i mongoose-encryption
```

A constant secret is defined in the app.js. The [mongoose-encryption](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-encryption) package gets added as a plugin to the mongoose userSchema defined where secret is passed over as an object along with an option to only encrypt the user passwords field.

app.js:
```
const encrypt = require('mongoose-encryption');
const secret = "Thisisourlittlesecret.";
userSchema.plugin(encrypt, { secret: secret, encryptedFields: ["password"] });

```
 When a new user is created upon registration, `save` is called and their password is encrypted. Upon user login, `find` is used on the document to locate the already existing user email in the database and decrypts their password.

The second user has an email of a@b.com with a password of qwerty, however, the user's password has been encrypted and cannot be seen in the database. Whereas the first user, 1@2.com, has their password, 123, stored as just plain text since their account was created at Level 1 security where no encryption was used.

<img src="docs/Robo3T-NewUser2.png"/><br/>

<img src="docs/Robo3T-NewUser2a.png"/><br/>

At its current state, if the secrets website is hacked, the app.js can be accessed where the secret string is stored and the same package, [mongoose-encryption](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-encryption), can be installed and used to decrypt the user's passwords in the database since the plain text version can be recovered.

Next layer of encryption will involve the usage of environment variables which helps store secrets like encryption keys and API keys.

## Level 2b - Encryption Using Environment Variables
Environment variables will be loaded from a .env into process.env using the NPM package [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

### NPM Package - dotenv
```sh
$ npm i dotenv
```

At the very top of the app.js the following line of code must be added:
```
require('dotenv').config()
```
Then a .env file is created at the root directory and the environment variables must be created in the form of `NAME=VALUE` for [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

In this step, the secrets constant was removed from the app.js, reformatted, and placed in the .env file.

app.js :

```
const secret = "Thisisourlittlesecret.";
```

.env :

```
SECRET=Thisisourlittlesecret.
```

**NOTE :** Any usernames, passwords and keys shown are just for demonstration purposes and are not used for the deployed app üê±‚Äçüíª.

## Level 3 - Hashing with md5
For level 3 security, the user password will not be encrypted but instead converted into a **hash value** via a **hash function**. The password gets stored as a hash value in the database and is then compared to the hash value produced when the user tries to login using the password they registered with.

Only the user will know the plain text version of the password while the database stores a hashed version.

The [MD5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/md5) NPM package (based off the MD5 hash function) is used for this example.

### NPM Package - md5
```sh
$ npm i md5
```

app.js:
```
const md5 = require('md5');
```

The third user is registered as user@hash.com and their password has been replaced with a hash value as seen below in the Robo3T MongoDB GUI.

#### Registration with md5

#### Robo3T MongoDB GUI
The database GUI shows three registered users and how their passwords are stored in the database for Levels 1-3. Level 1 depicts basic username and password creation, Level 2 shows the password being encrypted, and Level 3 demonstrates the password being stored as a hash value in the database.

<img src="docs/Robo3T-NewUser3.png"/><br/>

<img src="docs/Robo3T-NewUser3a.png"/><br/>

MD5 hashing algorithm will always produces the same hash value for a plain text password created by a user which is problematic if a database is hacked. If a hacker obtains a list of hash values associated with user accounts, hash tables (which contain hash values for commonly used plain text passwords) can be used to match the hash values and get its corresponding plain text version of the user's password that can be used to hack user's account.

<img src="docs/hashTable.png" /><br>

Level 4 demonstrates how **salting** a hash value adds an extra layer of security.

## Level 4 - Hashing and Salting with bcrypt
Another hashing algorithm, [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt), can generate a random set of characters, called a **salt**, which gets added to the user's password when they create it. The salt essentially adds length to the user's password which results in a more complex hash value created by the hash function. Both the salt and hash are stored in the database in place of the user's plain text password.

A unique salt is generated for each user that creates a new account and both the salt and hash is stored in the database‚ÄîSo even users with the same plain text password will have different hash values. This means that even if a hacker were to gain access to a database, they won't be able to obtain the plain text versions of the passwords as easily from a hash table due to the salting.

<img src="docs/salt.png"/><br>

An extra layer of security can be added by increasing the number of **salt rounds** a hash value goes through. So once a hash is created, a salt can be added to that value to produce a new hash and then that resulting hash can be salted to produce a new hash, and so on.
<img src="docs/salt1.png" /><br>

<img src="docs/salt2.png" /><br>

After the desired number of salting rounds have been executed, the resulting hash will be stored in the database. The higher the number of rounds you decide to salt your hashes, the longer it takes to produce the resulting hash‚Äîso more GPU computing power will be needed for more rounds üê±‚Äçüíª!

For [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) the cost for the salting rounds are displayed below. For this example, 10 rounds is sufficient.

<img src="docs/saltRounds.png" /><br>

### NPM Package - bcrypt
```sh
$ npm i bcrypt
```

app.js:
```
const bcrypt = require("bcrypt");
const saltRounds = 10;
```

The hash function gets added at the register post route and the password gets stored as the hash generated by the function:

```
bcrypt.hash(myPlaintextPassword, saltRounds, function(err, hash) {
    // Store hash in your password DB.
});
```

For the login route, the bcrypt compare method will be used when verifying the password entered versus a hashed and salted version of the password stored in the database:

```
bcrypt.compare(myPlaintextPassword, hash, function(err, result) {
    // result == true
});
```
### Registration with bcrypt
The fourth user was registered with the user name of user@bcrypthash.com.
<img src="/docs/register4.png" /><br>

#### Robo3T MongoDB GUI
The database shows Levels 1-4 users and how their passwords are stored in the database. The fourth user's password is stored as a hash value with 10 rounds of salting.

## Level 5 - Cookies and Sessions
The type of cookies being worked with in this level are those that establish and maintain a session. A session is a period of time a browser interacts with a server. A session cookie gets created when you've logged into a website and your credentials have been authenticated. This cookie remains active during your session and allows you to navigate throughout the site without having to login and verify your credentials again. Once you logout, the session cookie gets destroyed and you can no longer freely navigate the site that requires valid user credentials without having to login again.

Implementation of cookie sessions, salting, hashing, and user authentication will be done through [passport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport). Passport also enables user authentication through several different services such as Google, Facebook, or Twitter.

[passport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport)
[passport-local](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-local)
[passport-local-mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-local-mongoose)
[express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session)

### NPM Packages - passport, passport-local, passport-local-mongoose, express-session
```sh
$ npm i passport passport-local passport-local-mongoose express-session
```

app.js:
```
const session = require("express-session");
const passport = require("passport");
const passportLocalMongoose = require("passport-local-mongoose");
```

### Establish Session in app.js
Add the session code after any `app.use` and right before `mongoose.connect`

app.js:
```
app.use(session({
  secret: 'keyboard cat',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false
}));
```

### Initialize Passport
Right below the session code, initialize [passport](https://www.passportjs.org/docs/configure/) and use passport to set up the session.

app.js:
```
app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session())

```
### Set-up passport-local-mongoose
Create a new mongoose schema and add [passport-local-mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-local-mongoose) as a plugin. This will be used to hash and salt user passwords and save users into the MongoDB database.

Below creating the userSchema in app.js:
```
userSchema.plugin(passportLocalMongoose);
```

#### Simplified Passport/Passport-Local Configuration
A local strategy must be created to authenticate users using their username and password. Then the user will be serialized and deserialized which is necessary when using sessions. When a user is seralized, a session cookie is created which contains the user's identification and deserialization allows passport to open the session cookie and discover the identification of the user so that they may be authenticated on the server.

Below creating the User mongoose model in app.js:
```
passport.use(User.createStrategy());

passport.serializeUser(User.serializeUser());
passport.deserializeUser(User.deserializeUser());
```

### User Registration with passport-local-mongoose
The register method provided by the passport-local-mongoose package is used to create and save a new user.

In the post method for the register route:

```
// passport-local-mongoose
User.register({
  username: req.body.username
}, req.body.password, function(errm user) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
    res.redirect("/register");
  } else {
    passport.authenticate("local")(req, res, function() {
      res.redirect("/secrets");
    });
  }
});
```

#### Verify Authentication with Passport
Once a user is registered or has successfully logged in, a session cookie gets created (that the browser holds on to) which contains information about the user‚Äînamely letting the server know that the user is authenticated. The user will then be redirected to the secrets page (listing user secrets) if their authentication is valid, else they get redirected to the login screen.

app.js:
```
// secrets route
app.get("/secrets", function(req, res) {

  // check if user is authenticated
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
    res.render("secrets");
  } else {
    res.redirect("/login");
  }
});
```

### Registration with passport-local-mongoose
The fifth user was registered with the user name of user@passportlocalmongoose.com.
<img src="/docs/register5.png" /><br>

#### Robo3T MongoDB GUI
The database shows Levels 1-5 users and how their passwords are stored in the database. The fifth user's password is stored with a hash and salt value provided by the passport-local-mongoose package.

<img src="/docs/Robo3T-NewUser5.png"/><br>

<img src="/docs/Robo3T-NewUser5a.png"/><br>

If the fifth user were to go to the homepage and then navigate back to the secrets page, they will be able to successfully without needing to login again due to the cookie that has saved the session ID.

The session cookie that was stored for the localhost URL where the Secrets app is hosted, called connect.sid, shows it expires or gets deleted once the user exits the browser. So the user will need to login again to gain access to privileged areas.

<img src="/docs/cookie1.png" />

### Login with passport
In the post method for the login route a new user is created.

app.js:
```
const user = new User({
  username: req.body.username,
  password: req.body.password
});
```

#### Passport Authentication
The user is authenticated using a `login()` function on called on the req object provided by the [passport](https://www.passportjs.org/docs/login/) package.

Underneath new user creation in the post method for the login route in app.js:
```
// passport login authentication
req.login(user, function(err){
  if(err){
    console.log(err);
  } else {
    passport.authenticate("local")(req, res, function(){
      res.redirect("/secrets");
    });
  }
});
```
### Deauthentication
When the user [logs out](https://www.passportjs.org/docs/logout/), they get deauthenticated, their session cookie expires and they get redirected from the secrets page back to the homepage where they can register or login.

app.js
```
// get method for logout
app.get("/logout", function(req,res){
  req.logout();
  res.redirect("/");
});

```

## Level 6 - Google OAuth 2.0 Authentication
